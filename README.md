Assumptions
1. Input files are located in the resource folder
2. Out files will be written into the path given folder.

As this is a simple problem I didn't chose to go with external APIs or framework.

# How to use
1. Put the input file in to the resource folder 
2. Set the input file and the output file path in the MainApp main method, where we call the Translator.translateDolphinToHuman() method.
3. Run the app
4. The output file will be writen into the specified path.
